- `rc.lua` : initial lua file called, functioning as an import list
- `helpers.lua` : bunch of utilities used by other files
- `config/` : contains implementation-specific config, could be made
system-aware eventually
- `ui` : contains the different themes available
- `decorations` : defines the properties of all windows
- `elemental` : widgets
- `evil` : widgets daemons, stuff that runs in the background
- `noodle` : other widgets?
